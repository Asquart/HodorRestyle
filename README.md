# HodorRestyle

This is an addon that changes appearance of Hodor Reflexes addon.


Todo/suggestions (just a rough collection of ideas submitted by other people, I don't promise to do any of them):
- add support for hodor animated icons
- add class + role icons (like in logs, Hardened Armor for DK tank, Whip for DK DD, Cauterize for DK healer)
- Resize box height (and number of bars drawn) based on the number of group members (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to only show the box when in a dungeon/ trial IsUnitInDungeon('player') (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to highlight your own DPS via affecting the saturation/ alpha layers of the other bars. (Make your own bar brighter) (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to change the class colours to a value you wish (submitted by Cyber)
- Rather than having everyones damage & dps in one text element if you split each element up individually it would allow you to align each bit of text nicely. (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to use a monospace font for DPS values, again just to align everything nicely (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to to show the Bosses Name in the Top Bar (This would allow screenshots of the deeps to be shared and show context to the screenshot) (submitted by Cyber)
- 'Minimal design' option, where you set the background opacity to 0 (Or a low value) and set the bars to be much thinner, and positioned below the player's names. (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to change which values are used for the sorting/ graph (ST vs Multi). Potentially add a keybind for this toggle? (submitted by Cyber)
- Option to switch alignment of entire GUI from left to right, due to the way the PC UI is positioned by default people are likely to have this element to the right of their screen, so having everything propagate from right to left would make some sense from this scenario. (submitted by Cyber)
